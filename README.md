CalvinCrowPersonalProject
=========================

Code used for CalvinCrow.com

The original things I wanted to do when creating this project were: 
1. Use fonts from Google (http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine) to use a different style font on my website. 
2. Make the website scalable for mobile (I learned to do this when I was originally going to do the talk on HTML5 and wanted to try it on my own website). 
3. Use the changing picture AJAX tool I learned during our tech talk on AJAX. 
4. Add animated social media images for linking to my Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and LinkedIn. I saw this on another project and thought it was slick.  
5. Add a "contact me" form and use the reCaptcha "tool" from Google on my website to make sure it wasn't systems contacting me.
6. Get a URL from a hosting company and upload my HTML and associated files to take my website to the Web. 

In the end I could not get the contact me form (number 5) to work on GoDaddy hosting. I tried a few different ways (recommendations on the site, the PHP mail() code, etc.) and nothing really worked. In fact, I found more people complaining about the drawbacks to hosting on GoDaddy because of this. Instead I added my email address to the social media page and renamed it "contact me". 

Furthermore, I didn't really want to blatantly rip-off someone else's social media link animations (number 4), so instead I used two different images for each link, one gray, one in color, and made it to when you mouse over the link it changes to the color version. 

All other things I wanted to do were done. Be sure to check out www.calvincrow.com on your mobile device as well to see how it scales. 

Going forward I would like to add more pictures and maybe change them up depending on what page I'm on. I would like to fix the contact form I discussed earlier to work and remove my email address from the site. I would like to make my "about" page a little more extensive and I'd also like to do something a little more creative with the home page.
